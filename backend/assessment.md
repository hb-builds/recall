# Quiz Master V2 - Project Assessment

This document outlines the assessment of the Quiz Master V2 backend project against the provided requirements.

## 1. Core Functionalities

### 1.1. Admin and User Login
- **Requirement:** A login/register form for user and admin login. The application should have only one admin identified by its role. Use Flask security or JWT for role-based access control. A suitable model to store and differentiate all types of users.
- **Assessment:**
    - **Login/Register:** The [`api/auth.py`](api/auth.py) file provides `/register` and `/login` endpoints.
    - **Admin Role:** The [`models/user.py`](models/user.py) has a `role` column, and the [`seeds.py`](seeds.py) file creates an admin user with the 'admin' role.
    - **RBAC:** The [`api/admin.py`](api/admin.py) file uses a custom `admin_required` decorator that checks the JWT for the 'admin' role, which is good.
    - **User Model:** The [`models/user.py`](models/user.py) `User` model is suitable for differentiating users.
- **Conclusion:** **Satisfied**. The implementation meets all the requirements for this section.

### 1.2. Admin Dashboard
- **Requirement:** Admin should be added when a new database is created. Admin can create/edit/delete subjects, chapters, and quizzes. Admin can search for users/subjects/quizzes. Shows summary charts.
- **Assessment:**
    - **Admin Creation:** The `flask seed` command in [`seeds.py`](seeds.py) creates the admin user. This is good.
    - **CRUD Operations:** The [`api/admin.py`](api/admin.py) file provides endpoints for CRUD operations on subjects, chapters, and quizzes.
    - **Search:** The [`api/admin.py`](api/admin.py) has a `/search` endpoint, but it's incomplete. It only searches for subjects. It needs to be extended to search for users and quizzes.
    - **Summary Charts:** There are no specific endpoints for generating data for summary charts on the admin dashboard. The [`api/analytics.py`](api/analytics.py) has some analytics, but not a comprehensive summary for the admin.
- **Conclusion:** **Partially Satisfied**. The core CRUD functionalities are present, but the search functionality is incomplete, and there's no dedicated endpoint for admin dashboard summary charts.

### 1.3. Quiz Management
- **Requirement:** Edit/delete a quiz. Admin specifies the date and duration of the quiz. Admin creates/edits/deletes MCQ questions inside a specific quiz.
- **Assessment:**
    - **Quiz CRUD:** The [`api/admin.py`](api/admin.py) file has endpoints to create, update, and delete quizzes, including setting the duration.
    - **Question CRUD:** The [`api/admin.py`](api/admin.py) file has endpoints to create, update, and delete questions for a quiz.
- **Conclusion:** **Satisfied**.

### 1.4. User Dashboard
- **Requirement:** The user can attempt any quiz. Every quiz has a timer. Each quiz score is recorded. Earlier quiz attempts are shown. To be able to see the summary charts.
- **Assessment:**
    - **Attempt Quiz:** The [`api/quiz.py`](api/quiz.py) file provides endpoints to get quizzes and submit attempts.
    - **Quiz Timer:** The `duration_min` is stored in the `Quiz` model, but there is no server-side enforcement of the timer during an attempt. This should be handled by the frontend, but a server-side check upon submission would be ideal.
    - **Score Recording:** The `Attempt` model in [`models/attempt.py`](models/attempt.py) stores the score.
    - **View Attempts:** The [`api/user.py`](api/user.py) file has an endpoint to list a user's attempts.
    - **Summary Charts:** Similar to the admin dashboard, there are no specific endpoints for user summary charts. The [`api/analytics.py`](api/analytics.py) has some user-specific analytics, but not a comprehensive summary.
- **Conclusion:** **Partially Satisfied**. The core functionality is there, but the quiz timer is not enforced on the backend, and there are no dedicated endpoints for user dashboard summary charts.

## 2. Backend Jobs

### 2.1. Scheduled Job - Daily Reminders
- **Requirement:** Send daily reminders to users who have not visited or when a new quiz is created.
- **Assessment:** The [`tasks/reminder_tasks.py`](tasks/reminder_tasks.py) file has a `send_daily_reminders` task. It sends a reminder to users who haven't attempted a quiz in the last 24 hours. It does not, however, check for new quizzes created since the user's last visit.
- **Conclusion:** **Partially Satisfied**. The basic reminder functionality is there, but it could be improved to be more specific about new quizzes.

### 2.2. Scheduled Job - Monthly Activity Report
- **Requirement:** Devise a monthly report for the user created using HTML and sent via mail.
- **Assessment:** The [`tasks/reminder_tasks.py`](tasks/reminder_tasks.py) file has a `send_monthly_reports` task that uses the `report_service` to generate an HTML report and the `email_service` to send it. The [`templates/monthly_report.html`](templates/monthly_report.html) file exists.
- **Conclusion:** **Satisfied**.

### 2.3. User Triggered Async Job - Export as CSV
- **Requirement:** Devise a CSV format for quiz details for the user or all quizzes for the admin.
- **Assessment:**
    - **User Export:** The [`api/user.py`](api/user.py) file has an endpoint to trigger the `generate_user_attempts_csv` task in [`tasks/export_tasks.py`](tasks/export_tasks.py). This generates a CSV of the user's attempts.
    - **Admin Export:** There is no corresponding functionality for the admin to export all quizzes or user details.
- **Conclusion:** **Partially Satisfied**. The user export is implemented, but the admin export is missing.

## 3. Performance and Caching

- **Requirement:** Add caching where required to increase performance. Add cache expiry. API Performance.
- **Assessment:**
    - **Caching:** The project uses Flask-Caching with a Redis backend. The [`extensions.py`](extensions.py) file initializes the cache. Caching is used in [`tasks/export_tasks.py`](tasks/export_tasks.py) to store the path to the generated CSV. However, there is no other explicit caching on any of the hot paths, like the public-facing GET endpoints for subjects, chapters, or quizzes.
    - **Cache Expiry:** The cache that is used has a timeout.
    - **API Performance:** The [`api/analytics.py`](api/analytics.py) file uses a rate limiter, which is good for preventing abuse. The database queries seem to be reasonably optimized, but could benefit from caching.
- **Conclusion:** **Partially Satisfied**. The caching infrastructure is in place, but it's underutilized. Caching could be added to several endpoints to improve performance.

## 4. Recommended and Optional Functionalities

- **Requirement:** Well-designed PDF reports, external APIs for charts, responsive UI, frontend validation, backend validation, styling, login system, dummy payment portal.
- **Assessment:**
    - **PDF Reports:** The monthly report is in HTML, not PDF.
    - **External APIs for Charts:** The backend provides analytics endpoints that can be used by a charting library on the frontend.
    - **Responsive UI:** This is a frontend concern.
    - **Frontend Validation:** This is a frontend concern.
    - **Backend Validation:** The backend has some basic validation (e.g., checking for required fields), but it could be more robust. For example, it doesn't validate data types or lengths in many places.
    - **Styling:** This is a frontend concern.
    - **Login System:** A proper JWT-based login system is implemented.
    - **Dummy Payment Portal:** This is not implemented.
- **Conclusion:** **Partially Satisfied**. The backend provides the necessary data for charts and has a solid login system. However, backend validation could be improved, and the monthly report is not in PDF format. The other items are either frontend concerns or optional features that have not been implemented.

## 5. Summary and Proposed Plan

### 5.1. Overall Assessment
The project is in a good state. The core functionalities are mostly implemented, and the project structure is sound. However, there are several areas that need improvement to fully meet the requirements.

### 5.2. Key Gaps and Issues
1.  **Incomplete Admin Search:** The admin search functionality is not fully implemented.
2.  **Missing Dashboard Analytics:** There are no dedicated endpoints for the admin and user dashboard summary charts.

5.  **Missing Admin CSV Export:** The admin cannot export data to CSV.
6.  **Underutilized Caching:** Caching is not used on several key endpoints.
7.  **Limited Backend Validation:** Backend data validation is minimal.
8.  **HTML instead of PDF Reports:** The monthly report is in HTML format, not PDF.

### 5.3. Proposed Plan
I will now update the `TODO.md` with a more detailed plan for the implementation phase. The plan will prioritize the most critical issues first.
